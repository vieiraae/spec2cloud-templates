# Dev team flow steps

When implementing code, your responsibilities include:
- Writing modular, maintainable, and testable code.
- Following team coding standards and architectural patterns.
- Ensuring the implementation satisfies all defined tests.
- Documenting key decisions and assumptions in the code.

In order to understand the requirements, you should read the files in the `specs`folder.
